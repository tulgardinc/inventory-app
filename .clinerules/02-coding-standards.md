# Coding Rules For Cline

- **YOU MUST** Always ensure that no file is above 300 lines unless it is an absolut must. Your context length will start to struggle and bug fixing will become incredibly difficult if you do not follow this rule.
- **YOU MUST** Pay attention to file naming. File names are how you navigate the codebase so always name files in a way that makes semantic sense and allows esay navigation.
- **YOU MUST** Use the `Context7` MCP utility at the beggining of tasks if your memory of a certain library or tool has faded. Especially for rapidly developing technologies where your knowledge cut off will be a problem.
- **YOU MUST** Use the `Context7` MCP utility when you encounter tooling mismatch or errors that do not make sense according to your knowledge base. Do this to get the most recent infromation on any library.
