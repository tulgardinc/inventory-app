# Workflow: Update Progress

**Trigger:** `/update-progress`
**Inputs:** `ISSUE` (number or URL)

## Intent

Publish a concise public update to the issue while keeping rich details and reasoning in local memory.

## Steps for Cline

1. Read `memory-bank/activeContext.md` & `memory-bank/progress.md`.
2. Summarize key points into a TL;DR update (≤ 6 bullets): **Done / Next / Blockers / Notes**.
3. Post this summary as a comment on the issue.
4. If applicable, update checklists in the issue body.
5. Adjust labels to reflect any change in status.

## Shell Commands

```bash
ISSUE="${ISSUE:?issue required}"

# 1) Cline prepares the compact update text in /tmp/issue-update.md
# 2) Post the comment
gh issue comment "$ISSUE" --body-file /tmp/issue-update.md

# 3) Optionally adjust labels (example)
# gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --add-label "status: needs review"
```

## Comment Template (generated by Cline)

```
**Progress update** (YYYY-MM-DD):
- Done: …
- Next: …
- Blockers: …
- Notes: …
```

## Cline Must Also

* Keep full reasoning, experiments, and detailed logs in `memory-bank/progress.md`.
* Only include relevant public-facing updates in the GitHub comment.
* If the public update marks completion of an acceptance criteria item, tick it in the issue checklist.
