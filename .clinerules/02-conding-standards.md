# Coding Rules For Cline

- **YOU MUST** Always ensure that no file is above 300 lines unless it is an absolut must. Your context length will start to struggle and bug fixing will become incredibly difficult if you do not follow this rule.
- **YOU MUST** Pay attention to file naming. File names are how you navigate the codebase so always name files in a way that makes semantic sense and allows esay navigation.
