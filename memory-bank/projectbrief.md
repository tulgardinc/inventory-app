# Project Brief: Inventory Management Mobile App

## Project Overview
A cross-platform mobile application for iOS and Android that enables users to create and manage personal inventory lists with barcode scanning capabilities.

**Current Status**: Phase 2 Complete - Core inventory and item management fully operational with comprehensive testing (December 8, 2025)

## Core Requirements âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### Primary Features âœ… COMPLETE
- âœ… Create and manage multiple inventory lists
- âœ… Scan barcodes to add items (camera integration ready for product data API)
- âœ… Store comprehensive item information locally with SQLite
- ðŸ”„ Search and filter items across inventories (Phase 4 - planned)
- âœ… Full CRUD operations for inventories and items

### Data Storage Requirements âœ… COMPLETE
Each item stores all required fields:
- âœ… Item name
- âœ… Item quantity (manually set)
- âœ… Item price  
- âœ… Item category (user-entered, ready for auto-population via API)
- âœ… Item physical location (user-entered)
- âœ… Item description (user-entered, ready for auto-population)
- âœ… Entry date (with native date picker)
- âœ… Expiration date (with native date picker and expiration indicators)
- âœ… Barcode field (captured via modern camera integration)

### Technical Constraints âœ… MET
- âœ… Data stored entirely locally on device via SQLite with repository pattern
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android via Expo React Native)
- âœ… Offline-first approach implemented (ready for online API integration)
- âœ… Extensively tested (64/64 tests passing, 100% success rate, TDD methodology)

### User Experience Goals âœ… ACHIEVED
- âœ… Modern, sleek, minimalistic UI with GlueStack UI + NativeWind
- âœ… Easy barcode scanning workflow with expo-camera CameraView
- âœ… Intuitive inventory and item management with file-based navigation
- ðŸ”„ Fast search and filtering capabilities (Phase 4 - planned)
- âœ… Each barcode scan creates a new item entry (confirmed behavior)

### Success Criteria âœ… ACHIEVED
- âœ… Users can quickly add items via barcode scanning (camera integration complete)
- ðŸ”„ Items are easily searchable and filterable (basic functionality exists, Phase 4 for advanced features)
- âœ… Data persists reliably across app sessions (SQLite with ACID compliance)
- âœ… App works seamlessly offline (local-first design)
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability (64/64 tests passing)

## Implementation Status Summary

### âœ… Phase 1 Complete: Foundation (Issues #16, #2, #1)
- Dependencies installation (GlueStack UI, SQLite, Zustand, testing libraries)
- SQLite database service layer with repository pattern
- Migration system with versioning
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure

### âœ… Phase 2 Complete: Core CRUD Operations (Issues #3, #4, #5)
- Complete inventory management system
- Complete item management system with all 8 data fields
- Modern camera integration (expo-camera with CameraView)
- Form validation with Zod schemas
- File-based navigation with Expo Router
- Critical navigation bug resolved (store mismatch fixed)

### ðŸ”„ Phase 3 Planned: API Integration
- Product data fetching from barcode scans (Open Food Facts, UPC Database)
- Automatic item data population
- Enhanced barcode scanning workflow

### ðŸ”„ Phase 4 Planned: Advanced Features
- Search and filtering system
- Batch operations
- Advanced UX improvements

## Current Capabilities (Fully Operational)

The app now provides:
1. **Multi-Inventory Support**: Create, view, edit, delete multiple inventories
2. **Comprehensive Item Management**: Full CRUD with all 8 data fields including dates and barcode
3. **Modern UI**: GlueStack UI components with consistent design system
4. **Database Integration**: Reliable SQLite storage with repository pattern
5. **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with Zod schemas
6. **Camera Integration**: Modern barcode scanning ready for product API integration
7. **Navigation**: Seamless flow between inventories and items (bug-free)
8. **Testing**: 100% test success rate with comprehensive coverage

## Non-Requirements (Future Enhancements)
- Data export/backup functionality (Phase 5+ consideration)
- Cloud synchronization (not planned - privacy-focused local storage)
- Multi-user functionality (not in scope)
- Advanced reporting features (Phase 5+ consideration)

## Technology Implementation âœ… COMPLETE

### Implemented Stack
- âœ… Expo React Native ~53.0.20 (TypeScript)
- âœ… GlueStack UI v2 + NativeWind for styling
- âœ… SQLite (expo-sqlite) for local data storage
- âœ… Zustand for state management
- âœ… Zod for validation
- âœ… expo-camera for modern barcode scanning
- âœ… Jest + React Native Testing Library for testing
- âœ… File-based routing with Expo Router

### Architecture Implemented
- Repository pattern for database operations
- Zustand store with database integration (`useDatabaseStore`)
- Component-based architecture with reusable forms
- TDD methodology with comprehensive test coverage
- Modern React Native patterns and best practices

## Development Status

**Current**: Issue #5 complete, awaiting code review via PR #22
**Next**: Phase 3 (API Integration) ready to begin once PR #22 is merged
**Quality**: 64/64 tests passing, zero critical bugs, app fully functional

This inventory management app now provides a complete, tested foundation for personal inventory management with all core requirements implemented and ready for advanced feature development.
