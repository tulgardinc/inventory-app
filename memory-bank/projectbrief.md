# Project Brief: Inventory Management Mobile App

## Project Overview
A cross-platform mobile application for iOS and Android that enables users to create and manage personal inventory lists with barcode scanning capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Features
- Create and manage multiple inventory lists
- Scan barcodes to add items with automatic product data population
- Store comprehensive item information locally
- Search and filter items across inventories
- Full CRUD operations for inventories and items

### Data Storage Requirements
Each item must store:
- Item name
- Item quantity (manually set)
- Item price  
- Item category (populated automatically from barcode if possible)
- Item physical location (user-entered)
- Item description (auto-populated when possible)
- Entry date
- Expiration date (user-populated if applicable)

### Technical Constraints
- Data stored entirely locally on device (no cloud storage)
- Must work on both iOS and Android
- Offline-first approach with online API calls for barcode data when available
- Extensively testable (unit tests for database operations, E2E tests for user flows)

### User Experience Goals
- Modern, sleek, minimalistic UI
- Easy barcode scanning workflow
- Intuitive inventory and item management
- Fast search and filtering capabilities
- Each barcode scan creates a new item entry (no automatic quantity updates)

### Success Criteria
- Users can quickly add items via barcode scanning
- Items are easily searchable and filterable
- Data persists reliably across app sessions
- App works seamlessly offline
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

## Non-Requirements (MVP Scope)
- Data export/backup functionality (nice-to-have for future)
- Cloud synchronization
- Multi-user functionality
- Advanced reporting features

## Technology Preferences
- Expo React Native (already established)
- Gluestack UI with NativeWind for styling
- SQLite for local data storage
- Modern development practices with TypeScript
