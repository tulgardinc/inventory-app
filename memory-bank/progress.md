# Progress: What Works, What's Left, Current Status

## Current Status
**Phase**: Pre-Development Documentation Complete  
**Last Updated**: December 8, 2025  
**Overall Progress**: 0% Development, 100% Planning Complete

## What Works (Completed)

### âœ… Foundation Documentation
- **Project Brief**: Core requirements, scope, and success criteria defined
- **Product Context**: User needs, problem statement, and solution approach documented
- **System Architecture**: Technical patterns, component hierarchy, and data flow planned
- **Tech Stack**: Dependencies, constraints, and setup requirements identified
- **Active Context**: Current focus, decisions, and next steps outlined

### âœ… Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Database Schema**: SQLite table structure designed for inventories and items
- **Navigation Structure**: Expo Router file-based routing planned
- **Component Architecture**: Hierarchical component structure defined
- **State Management**: Zustand + React Context pattern selected
- **API Integration**: Product data fetching strategy with fallback chain planned

### âœ… Development Environment Foundation
- **Expo React Native**: Project initialized with TypeScript support
- **File Structure**: Basic app structure with tabs navigation already exists
- **Configuration**: ESLint, TypeScript, and Expo configuration in place
- **Git Repository**: Version control established with remote origin

## What's Left to Build (Development Roadmap)

### ðŸ”„ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Next)
**Dependencies Installation**
- [ ] Gluestack UI + NativeWind for modern UI components
- [ ] expo-sqlite for local database operations
- [ ] expo-barcode-scanner + expo-camera for scanning functionality
- [ ] Zustand for state management
- [ ] Zod for data validation
- [ ] Testing libraries (Jest, React Native Testing Library, Detox)

**Core Infrastructure**
- [ ] Database service layer with SQLite migrations
- [ ] Basic app navigation structure (replace current placeholder tabs)
- [ ] TypeScript types and interfaces for core entities
- [ ] Initial testing setup and configuration

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Core Inventory Management
**Database Operations**
- [ ] Inventory CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Item CRUD operations with foreign key relationships
- [ ] Database migrations and schema versioning
- [ ] Data validation with Zod schemas

**Basic UI Implementation**
- [ ] Inventory list screen with create/edit functionality
- [ ] Item management screens (list, detail, create, edit)
- [ ] Form components with validation and error handling
- [ ] Navigation between inventories and items

### ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Barcode Integration
**Camera & Scanning**
- [ ] Camera permission handling and user consent flow
- [ ] Barcode scanner implementation with expo-barcode-scanner
- [ ] Scan result processing and validation
- [ ] Error handling for camera access denied

**Product Data Integration**
- [ ] API service for product data fetching (Open Food Facts primary)
- [ ] Fallback API integration (UPC Database secondary)
- [ ] Offline handling with graceful degradation to manual entry
- [ ] Barcode-to-item creation workflow

### ðŸ”„ Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Search & Filtering**
- [ ] Full-text search across item names and descriptions
- [ ] Advanced filtering (category, location, date ranges)
- [ ] Real-time search with debouncing for performance
- [ ] Sort options (name, date, quantity, expiration)

**Enhanced User Experience**
- [ ] Item editing and moving between inventories
- [ ] Batch operations (delete multiple items, bulk editing)
- [ ] Data export functionality (CSV/JSON) - future enhancement
- [ ] UI animations and polish

### ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Comprehensive Testing**
- [ ] Unit tests for database operations and business logic
- [ ] Component testing with React Native Testing Library
- [ ] Integration tests for API services and data flow
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete user workflows with Detox

**Performance & Polish**
- [ ] Performance optimization (lazy loading, virtual lists)
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for large inventories
- [ ] Error boundary implementation for graceful error handling
- [ ] Final UI/UX refinements and accessibility improvements

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **No Development Started**: All work so far is planning and documentation
- **Dependency Versions**: Need to verify compatibility of all planned dependencies
- **API Rate Limits**: Product APIs may have usage restrictions that need handling
- **Platform Testing**: Will need both iOS and Android testing environments

### Future Considerations
- **Data Migration**: Future schema changes will need migration strategies
- **Backup Solutions**: Local-only storage means no automatic backup (user education needed)
- **Performance at Scale**: Large inventories (1000+ items) may need optimization
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and accessibility compliance needed

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Requirements Refinement
**Original Request**: "Mobile app for inventory lists with barcode scanning"

**Refined to Specific Requirements**:
- Multiple inventory support (not just single list)
- Comprehensive item data (price, location, expiration, etc.)
- Each scan creates new item (not quantity increment)
- Local storage only (privacy-focused approach)
- Extensive testing requirements (reliability-focused)

### Technical Stack Evolution
**UI Framework Decision**: Started with basic React Native â†’ Decided on Gluestack UI
- Reasoning: Modern, accessible components with consistent design system
- Alternative considered: NativeBase (chosen Gluestack for better TypeScript support)

**State Management Decision**: Considered Redux â†’ Selected Zustand
- Reasoning: Simpler API, better TypeScript integration, smaller bundle size
- Hybrid approach: Zustand for global state + React Context for component trees

**Database Decision**: Confirmed SQLite over alternatives
- Alternatives considered: Realm, WatermelonDB
- Reasoning: SQLite provides ACID compliance, wide platform support, familiar SQL interface

### User Experience Insights
**Barcode-First Approach**: Scanning should be the primary way to add items
- Manual entry as fallback, not primary method
- UI should make scanning easily accessible (dedicated tab)

**Multiple Inventories**: Users need organizational flexibility
- Home/Office/Storage separation
- No limit on number of inventories
- Easy item movement between inventories

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Install Core Dependencies**: Add Gluestack UI, SQLite, and other essential packages
2. **Database Setup**: Implement schema and basic CRUD operations
3. **Replace Placeholder UI**: Replace current basic tabs with inventory-focused navigation
4. **Set Up Testing**: Configure Jest and React Native Testing Library

## Success Metrics Tracking
- **Code Coverage**: Target >90% for database operations, >80% overall
- **Performance**: Database queries <100ms, search responses <200ms
- **User Experience**: <3 taps to add item via barcode
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss during normal operations
