# Active Context

## Current Issue
**Issue #2**: Phase 1: Implement SQLite Database Service Layer  
**URL**: https://github.com/tulgardinc/inventory-app/issues/2  
**Branch**: `phase1-sqlite-database`  
**Status**: In Progress

## Scope & Acceptance Criteria

### Overview
Create the core database service layer with SQLite integration, schema setup, and basic CRUD operations.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Database creates tables on first run
- CRUD operations work for both inventories and items  
- Foreign key relationships maintain data integrity
- TypeScript types match database schema
- Database operations include proper error handling

### Database Components to Build
- Database connection and initialization
- Schema migrations for inventories and items tables
- Service layer for database operations
- TypeScript interfaces for database entities

## Plan of Attack

### Phase 1: Core Database Setup
1. **Create database service module** (`lib/database.ts`)
   - Initialize expo-sqlite connection
   - Database configuration and error handling

2. **Implement database schema** 
   - CREATE TABLE statements for inventories and items
   - Foreign key relationships and constraints
   - Proper indexing for performance

3. **Build migration system**
   - Version tracking for schema changes
   - Safe migration execution
   - Rollback capabilities

### Phase 2: TypeScript Integration  
4. **Create database entity interfaces**
   - DatabaseInventory and DatabaseItem types
   - Mapping between Zustand store types and DB types

### Phase 3: CRUD Operations
5. **Implement inventory CRUD operations**
   - Create, read, update, delete for inventories
   - Integration with existing Zustand store

6. **Implement item CRUD operations** 
   - Create, read, update, delete for items
   - Relationship management with inventories

7. **Database initialization and seeding**
   - First-run setup
   - Optional sample data

## Assumptions & Constraints

- **expo-sqlite** already installed and configured
- Existing Zustand store patterns should be preserved
- Current Zod schemas in `lib/schemas.ts` define the data structure
- Database should work offline-first
- Need to maintain compatibility with existing form components

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: Use transactions for batch operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and logging
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript integration between DB and store
- **Migration Safety**: Careful schema versioning and backwards compatibility

## Open Questions

1. Should we migrate existing Zustand store data to database on first run?
2. How do we handle data synchronization between Zustand store and database?
3. Do we need connection pooling or is single connection sufficient?
4. Should we implement soft delete or hard delete for items/inventories?

## Current Progress

- ✅ Branch created: `phase1-sqlite-database`
- ✅ Issue analysis complete
- ✅ Database service implementation COMPLETE
- ✅ All core components implemented:
  - Database connection and configuration system
  - Migration system with schema versioning
  - Complete CRUD operations for inventories and items
  - Database types and interfaces for type safety
  - ID generator utility for unique identifiers
  - Database-integrated Zustand store
  - Error handling and transaction support
- ✅ Coding standards followed (all files under 300 lines)
- ✅ Changes committed to git
- ⏳ Ready for testing and PR creation

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Create `lib/database.ts` with basic connection setup
2. Define database schema with CREATE TABLE statements  
3. Implement migration system
4. Create TypeScript interfaces for database entities
5. Build CRUD operations for inventories
6. Build CRUD operations for items
7. Test database integration with existing components
