# Active Context

## Current Issue
**Issue #5**: Phase 2: Implement Item CRUD Operations and UI
**URL**: https://github.com/tulgardinc/inventory-app/issues/5
**Branch**: `item-crud-operations`
**Status**: In Progress

## Scope & Acceptance Criteria

Build the core item management screens with full CRUD functionality for all 8 item fields:
- name, quantity, price, category, location, description, entry date, expiration date

**Requirements:**
- Item list display within each inventory
- Create new item form with all required fields
- Edit existing item details
- Delete items with confirmation
- Item detail view with full information
- Date picker for entry and expiration dates
- Comprehensive Zod validation
- Gluestack UI styling throughout

## Plan of Attack

### Phase 1: Enhanced Item Schema & Validation
- [ ] Expand Zod schemas for all 8 item fields with proper validation
- [ ] Add date validation and formatting utilities
- [ ] Update database types for comprehensive item data

### Phase 2: Item List Screen Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Enhance existing ItemListScreen component (`app/inventories/[id]/items/index.tsx`)
- [x] Add comprehensive item display with all 8 fields
- [x] Implement delete functionality with confirmation dialogs
- [x] Add navigation to item detail view and create screens
- [x] Add expiration status indicators (EXPIRED, EXPIRING SOON)
- [x] Add loading states and error handling
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite (17 tests) - ALL PASSING ✅

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Item Forms
- [ ] Build complete ItemCreateForm with all 8 fields
- [ ] Implement ItemEditForm with pre-populated data
- [ ] Add date picker components for entry/expiration dates
- [ ] Connect forms to database service layer

### Phase 4: Item Detail Screen
- [ ] Create ItemDetailScreen showing all information clearly
- [ ] Add edit and delete actions
- [ ] Implement proper navigation flow

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all new components
- [ ] Ensure TDD compliance with failing tests first
- [ ] Polish UX and styling consistency

## Assumptions/Constraints

- Database layer already supports all item fields (verified in itemRepository.ts)
- Basic ItemForm components exist but need enhancement
- Navigation structure already established
- Testing infrastructure is operational (47/47 tests passing)
- Following TDD approach with commit gates

## Open Questions

- Should we implement batch operations for multiple item management?
- What level of offline support is needed for item operations?
- Are there specific business rules for item expiration date validation?

## Technical Foundation Available

- ✅ Database Layer: itemRepository.ts with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Store Integration: databaseStore.ts ready for item operations
- ✅ Navigation: File-based routing structure established
- ✅ Form Infrastructure: Basic components exist, need enhancement
- ✅ Testing: Jest + React Native Testing Library operational (64/64 tests passing)
- ✅ ItemsListScreen: Fully implemented with comprehensive 8-field display and delete operations
- ✅ Validation: Zod foundation established, needs expansion

## Recent Context

Just completed Issue #4 which resolved testing infrastructure blockers:
- Fixed InventoryForm Button mocking issue
- Relocated testUtils.tsx to proper location
- Achieved 100% test success rate (47/47 tests)
- All technical foundations now stable for continued development
