=======
## Current Issue
**Issue #16**: Phase 1: Install Core Dependencies and Setup UI Framework  
**URL**: https://github.com/tulgardinc/inventory-app/issues/16  
**Branch**: `phase1-core-dependencies`  
**Status**: In Review  
**PR**: https://github.com/tulgardinc/inventory-app/pull/17
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

## Immediate Focus
Setting up comprehensive memory bank documentation to guide development process according to established patterns and workflows.

## Recent Accomplishments
✅ **Project Brief Created** - Core requirements and scope defined  
✅ **Product Context Documented** - User needs and solution approach clarified  
✅ **System Architecture Planned** - Technical patterns and component structure outlined  
✅ **Tech Stack Documented** - Dependencies, setup requirements, and constraints identified  

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Key Technical Decisions Made
- **Database Choice**: SQLite with expo-sqlite for local storage
- **UI Framework**: Gluestack UI with NativeWind for modern, consistent design
- **Database Choice**: SQLite with expo-sqlite for local storage  
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state + React Context for component trees
- **Navigation**: Expo Router file-based routing (already configured)
- **Testing Strategy**: Jest + React Native Testing Library + Detox for E2E

### Design Philosophy Confirmed
- **Offline-First**: All core functionality works without internet
- **Barcode-Centric**: Scanning is the primary method for adding items
- **Multiple Inventories**: Users can organize items across different lists/locations
- **New Item Per Scan**: Each barcode scan creates a separate item entry

### User Experience Principles
- **Speed Over Features**: Core tasks should be fast and intuitive
- **Clear Organization**: Always obvious which inventory you're working in
- **Minimalist UI**: Clean, uncluttered interface with purposeful interactions
- **Graceful Degradation**: App handles errors and offline scenarios gracefully

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank** - Finish progress.md to track development phases
2. **Environment Setup** - Install required dependencies and configure tools
3. **Database Foundation** - Implement SQLite schema and basic operations
4. **Basic Navigation** - Set up core screen structure and routing

### Development Phase Roadmap
**Phase 1: Foundation** (Week 1)
- Install and configure Gluestack UI + dependencies
- Implement database service layer with migrations
- Create basic navigation structure
- Set up testing framework and initial tests

**Phase 2: Core Features** (Week 2-3)  
- Inventory CRUD operations with UI
- Basic item management (manual entry)
- Database integration and state management
- Form validation and error handling

**Phase 3: Barcode Integration** (Week 3-4)
- Camera permissions and barcode scanner
- Product API integration with fallback chain
- Barcode-to-item creation workflow
- Offline handling and error states

**Phase 4: Advanced Features** (Week 4-5)
- Search and filtering functionality
- Item editing and inventory management
- Performance optimization
- UI polish and animations

**Phase 5: Testing & Deployment** (Week 5-6)
- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- End-to-end test automation
- Performance testing and optimization
- App store preparation

## PR Summary

**Pull Request #17**: feat: Install core dependencies and setup UI framework

**Changes Completed:**
- ✅ Installed GlueStack UI + NativeWind for modern UI components
- ✅ Added expo-sqlite for local database operations  
- ✅ Added expo-barcode-scanner + expo-camera for scanning functionality
- ✅ Installed Zustand for state management
- ✅ Added Zod for data validation
- ✅ Configured NativeWind with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Set up GlueStack UI provider in app layout
- ✅ Created basic validation schemas and Zustand store
- ✅ Added test component to verify all dependencies work
- ✅ Metro bundler compiles successfully for mobile target

**Testing Results:**
- All dependencies install without conflicts
- Basic imports work in TypeScript  
- GlueStack UI components render properly
- App compiles and runs on iOS simulator
- Button interactions work (logged 'GlueStack UI Button Works!')
- No breaking changes to existing app structure

## Current Status
Issue #16 is complete and ready for review. All acceptance criteria have been met.

## Next Steps After Merge
Ready to proceed to Issue #17: Set up Testing Infrastructure

## Current Blockers & Considerations
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
**None currently** - Memory bank setup phase has no technical blockers

## Key Patterns & Preferences Emerging

### Code Organization Preferences
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Database operations centralized in service classes
- **Custom Hooks**: Business logic abstracted into reusable hooks
- **Component Composition**: Complex UI built from simple, reusable components
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage with Zod validation

### Testing Approach
- **TDD Workflow**: Tests written before implementation where feasible
- **Repository Testing**: Focus on database operations and data integrity
- **User Journey Testing**: E2E tests cover complete user workflows
- **Mock Strategy**: API calls mocked for reliable testing

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load inventory items on-demand
- **Debounced Search**: Real-time search with performance optimization
- **Image Optimization**: Efficient barcode scanner frame handling
- **Database Indexing**: Proper indices for search and filter queries

## Important Project Insights
- **Barcode APIs have limitations**: Need robust fallback strategy for product data
- **Camera permissions critical**: Core feature depends on camera access
- **Local storage only**: No cloud sync simplifies architecture but limits backup options
- **Cross-platform complexity**: iOS/Android differences need careful handling

This active context will be updated as development progresses and new insights emerge.
