# Active Context - Issue #1: Phase 1: Set Up Testing Infrastructure

**Issue URL:** https://github.com/tulgardinc/inventory-app/issues/1  
**Branch:** phase1-testing-infrastructure  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Started:** December 8, 2025

## Scope & Acceptance Criteria

Setting up comprehensive testing infrastructure to support TDD workflow with:
- Unit tests runnable with `npm test`
- Component tests using React Native Testing Library
- Detox e2e tests executable
- Test coverage reporting available
- All tests passing in CI environment

## Tasks from Issue

- [ ] Install React Native Testing Library
- [ ] Set up Detox for e2e testing  
- [ ] Configure Jest for React Native components
- [ ] Create test utilities and common mocks
- [ ] Set up test scripts in package.json
- [ ] Create example tests to verify setup
- [ ] Configure CI-friendly test commands

## Plan of Attack

1. **Analyze Current Setup**: Check existing Jest configuration and testing dependencies
2. **Install Testing Dependencies**: Add React Native Testing Library, Detox, and related packages
3. **Configure Jest**: Set up proper Jest config for React Native components and database testing
4. **Set Up Detox**: Configure e2e testing environment with proper device setup
5. **Create Test Utilities**: Build common mocks for database, navigation, and UI components
6. **Write Example Tests**: Create sample unit, component, and e2e tests to verify setup
7. **Configure Scripts**: Set up package.json scripts for different test types
8. **Verify CI Compatibility**: Ensure all tests run in headless/CI environment

## Assumptions & Constraints

- **Expo Environment**: Working within Expo managed workflow constraints
- **SQLite Database**: Need to mock/test database operations properly
- **React Navigation**: Need proper navigation mocking for component tests
- **GlueStack UI**: Need component library testing support
- **Coding Standards**: All test files must follow 300-line limit rule

## Technical Considerations

- **Database Testing**: Need to handle SQLite operations in test environment
- **Navigation Testing**: Mock Expo Router properly for component tests
- **Async Operations**: Handle Zustand store operations and database calls
- **Form Validation**: Test Zod schema validation properly
- **UI Component Testing**: Test GlueStack UI components with NativeWind styles

## Open Questions

- Should we use in-memory SQLite for tests or mock the database layer?
- What's the best approach for testing navigation in Expo Router?
- How to handle Metro bundler configuration for test environment?
- Should we test both the original store and databaseStore separately?

## Next Steps

1. Check current package.json for existing Jest configuration
2. Research Expo + React Native Testing Library best practices
3. Determine Detox compatibility with current Expo version
4. Plan database testing strategy (mocking vs in-memory)
