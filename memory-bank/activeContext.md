# Active Context - Issue #4: Inventory CRUD Operations

**Issue:** #4 - Phase 2: Implement Inventory CRUD Operations and UI
**URL:** https://github.com/tulgardinc/inventory-app/issues/4
**Branch:** phase2-inventory-crud
**Status:** COMPLETED - PR #21 Created
**PR URL:** https://github.com/tulgardinc/inventory-app/pull/21
**Started:** December 8, 2025

## Scope & Acceptance Criteria

Build the core inventory management screens with create, read, update, delete functionality and connect to database layer.

**User Stories:**
- Users can view list of all their inventories
- New inventories can be created with name and description
- Existing inventories can be edited and updated
- Inventories can be deleted with proper confirmation
- All forms include validation and error messages
- UI is responsive and follows design system

## Assumptions/Constraints

**Technical Foundation Available:**
- âœ… SQLite database service layer already implemented (`lib/database/inventoryRepository.ts`)
- âœ… Database-integrated Zustand store available (`lib/databaseStore.ts`)
- âœ… Zod validation schemas ready (`lib/schemas.ts`)
- âœ… Navigation structure established (`app/inventories/_layout.tsx`)
- âœ… Form components partially built (`components/forms/InventoryForm.tsx`)
- âœ… Testing infrastructure ready for TDD development

**Coding Standards:**
- All files must stay under 300 lines
- Follow semantic file naming conventions
- Use TDD approach with tests first

## Plan of Attack

**Phase 2A: Complete Inventory List Screen**
- Enhance `app/inventories/index.tsx` with proper inventory listing
- Connect to database store for real-time inventory data
- Add loading states and error handling
- Implement inventory navigation

**Phase 2B: Enhance Create & Edit Forms**
- Complete `app/inventories/create.tsx` integration
- Build inventory edit functionality with `app/inventories/[id]/edit.tsx`
- Ensure form validation and user feedback
- Connect forms to database operations

**Phase 2C: Implement Delete Functionality**
- Add delete confirmation modal/dialog
- Connect delete operations to database
- Handle cascade deletion considerations (items in inventory)
- Implement proper error handling

**Phase 2D: Polish User Experience**
- Add loading indicators during database operations  
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate
- Ensure proper navigation flows
- Add empty states and error boundaries

## Current Architecture Status

**Database Layer:** âœ… Complete and tested
- `inventoryRepository.createInventory()`
- `inventoryRepository.getInventories()`
- `inventoryRepository.getInventoryById()` 
- `inventoryRepository.updateInventory()`
- `inventoryRepository.deleteInventory()`

**Store Layer:** âœ… Available but needs integration
- `useDatabaseStore` with inventory operations
- Async loading states and error handling built-in

**UI Components:** ðŸ”„ Partially complete
- Basic form components exist but need full integration
- Navigation routes established but screens need completion

## Open Questions

1. **Delete Confirmation UX**: Should we use a modal, alert, or inline confirmation?
2. **Empty State**: What should users see when they have no inventories?
3. **Loading States**: Should we show skeletons or spinners during data loading?
4. **Error Recovery**: How should users recover from failed operations?

## Technical Decisions Made

- Using database-integrated Zustand store for state management
- Following existing navigation structure with file-based routing
- Leveraging GlueStack UI components for consistent design
- Implementing TDD approach with comprehensive test coverage

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Start with failing tests for inventory list functionality
2. Implement inventory listing with real database integration
3. Complete create inventory flow with proper feedback
4. Add edit functionality with form pre-population
5. Implement delete with confirmation dialog
