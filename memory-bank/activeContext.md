## Current Status: Issue #5 COMPLETE - Item CRUD Operations ✅

**Issue #5**: Phase 2: Implement Item CRUD Operations and UI
**URL**: https://github.com/tulgardinc/inventory-app/issues/5
**Branch**: `item-crud-operations`
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - PR #22 created and ready for review
**PR**: https://github.com/tulgardinc/inventory-app/pull/22
**Date Completed**: December 8, 2025, 5:04 PM CET
**Test Status**: 64/64 tests passing (100% success rate)

## Major Achievement: Navigation Bug Fixed

**CRITICAL BUG RESOLVED**: "List not found" navigation issue that prevented users from accessing created inventories.

**Root Cause**: Store mismatch between different screens using `useDatabaseStore` vs `useAppStore`
**Solution**: Updated all screens to use consistent `useDatabaseStore`
**Impact**: Users can now successfully create inventories and navigate to them
**Files Fixed**: 
- `app/inventories/[id]/index.tsx` 
- `app/inventories/create.tsx`

## Complete Implementation Summary

### ✅ Item CRUD System Fully Implemented
**All 8 Data Fields Supported**:
- name, quantity, price, category, location, description, entry_date, expiration_date, barcode

### ✅ Core Screens Completed
- **ItemsListScreen** (`app/inventories/[id]/items/index.tsx`) - Enhanced with comprehensive display, delete functionality, expiration indicators
- **ItemForm** (`components/forms/ItemForm.tsx`) - Complete form with modern barcode scanner (CameraView), date pickers, Zod validation  
- **ItemCreateScreen** (`app/inventories/[id]/items/create.tsx`) - Full database integration
- **ItemEditScreen** (`app/inventories/[id]/items/[itemId]/edit.tsx`) - Pre-populated editing
- **ItemDetailScreen** (`app/inventories/[id]/items/[itemId]/index.tsx`) - Complete information display with edit/delete actions

### ✅ Technical Foundation Solid
- **Database Integration**: Complete CRUD operations via `useDatabaseStore`
- **Modern Camera API**: Successfully migrated from deprecated `expo-barcode-scanner` to `expo-camera` with `CameraView`
- **Date Handling**: `@react-native-community/datetimepicker@8.4.1` integrated
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for all data structures
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage - 17 tests for ItemsListScreen alone, all passing

### ✅ Route Structure Complete
```
app/inventories/
├── index.tsx (list view - database integrated)
├── create.tsx (creation form - store issue fixed)  
├── [id]/
│   ├── index.tsx (detail view - "list not found" bug fixed)
│   └── items/
│       ├── index.tsx (items list - enhanced with 8-field display)
│       ├── create.tsx (item creation)
│       └── [itemId]/
│           ├── index.tsx (item detail)
│           └── edit.tsx (item editing)
```

## Acceptance Criteria: ALL COMPLETE ✅

- ✅ Item list display within each inventory with all 8 fields
- ✅ Create new item form with all required fields, date picker, barcode scanner
- ✅ Edit existing item details with pre-populated data
- ✅ Delete items with confirmation dialogs
- ✅ Item detail view with full information display
- ✅ Date picker for entry and expiration dates
- ✅ Comprehensive Zod validation for all forms
- ✅ GlueStack UI styling throughout
- ✅ Complete test coverage with TDD approach
- ✅ Navigation bug resolved - app fully functional

## Current State: Ready for Next Phase

**Development Phase Complete**: Core Item CRUD functionality is now fully implemented and tested. The app provides a complete inventory management experience with:

- Multi-inventory support
- Complete item management with all 8 data fields
- Modern barcode scanning capabilities
- Comprehensive form validation
- Robust error handling
- 100% test coverage for new features

## Next Development Options

Based on the solid foundation now in place, potential next phases include:

1. **Phase 3: Advanced Barcode Integration** - Automatic item creation from scanned products
2. **Phase 4: Search & Filtering** - Full-text search and advanced filtering across inventories
3. **Phase 5: Enhanced UX Features** - Batch operations, data export, advanced sorting
4. **Phase 6: Performance Optimization** - Virtual lists, caching, large inventory handling

## Technical Context

**Current Technology Stack in Active Use**:
- Expo React Native ~53.0.20 with file-based routing (Expo Router)
- GlueStack UI v2 + NativeWind for styling
- SQLite database with comprehensive CRUD operations
- Modern camera APIs: `expo-camera` with `CameraView` and `useCameraPermissions`
- Date picker: `@react-native-community/datetimepicker@8.4.1`
- Testing: Jest 29.7.0 + React Native Testing Library
- State management: Zustand with `useDatabaseStore`

**Key Patterns Successfully Implemented**:
- File-based routing structure with dynamic parameters
- Zustand store patterns with direct selectors (avoiding referential equality issues)
- Modern Expo Camera API usage with proper permission handling
- Database integration using repository pattern with SQLite
- Comprehensive form validation with Zod schemas
- TDD approach with comprehensive testing

## Open Questions & Considerations

**For Future Phases**:
- Should we prioritize barcode-to-product API integration next?
- What level of offline support is needed for advanced features?
- Are there specific performance requirements for large inventories (1000+ items)?
- Should we implement data backup/export functionality?

## No Immediate Action Required

Issue #5 is complete and awaiting code review via PR #22. No immediate development action is required. The memory bank will be updated again once the next development phase begins or when PR #22 is merged.
